This code represents a Java class called MySingletonClass that follows the Singleton design pattern and provides
a way to establish a connection to a database using JDBC(Java Database Connectivity).
1. The code begins with importing necessary classes for working with JDBC connections.
2. The class declaration starts with the public class MySingletonClass. This class will act as a singleton, meaning that only one instance of it can exist throughout the program.
3. The class has three private instance variables: url, username and password. These variables store the information needed to connect to a database.
4. The constructor of the class is marked as private, which means it cannot be accessed from outside the class. This prevents the creation of multiple instances of the class.
5. The class provides a public static method called getInstance() that returns the singleton instance of the class. This method follows the Singleton pattern by ensuring that only one instance of the class is created.
    It checks if the instance variable is null(indicating that no instance has been created yet), and if so, it creates a new instance of MySingletonClass. Otherwise, it simply returns the existing instance.
6. The class also provides a public method called getConnection() that establishes a connection to the database.It makes use of the DriverManager.getConnection() method provided by the JDBC API.
    The method attempts to establish a connection using the url, username, and password stored in the instance variables. If an exception occurs during the connection process, it throws a RuntimeException with the exception as the cause.
7. Lastly, the class includes getter methods for the url,username,an password variables, allowing other parts of the program to retrieve these values if needed.

In summary, this code creates a singleton class MySingletonClass that provides a single instance to connect to a database using JDBC. The getInstance() method ensures that only one instance of the class exists,
and the getConnection() method establishes a database connection using the stored URL, username, and password.
